{"name":"Moodle-format noticebd","tagline":"Noticeboard course format for Moodle.","body":"Introduction\r\n============\r\nTopic based course format with the latest post in the news forum displayed at the top.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gjb2048/moodle-format_noticebd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gjb2048/moodle-format_noticebd)\r\n\r\nRequired version of Moodle\r\n==========================\r\nThis version works with Moodle version 2015111600.00 3.0 (Build: 20151116) and above within the 3.0 branch until the\r\nnext release.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in 'Installing Moodle' on\r\n'docs.moodle.org/30/en/Installing_Moodle'.\r\n\r\nSupporting Noticeboard development\r\n==================================\r\nIf you find Noticeboard useful and beneficial, please consider sponsoring by:\r\n\r\nPayPal - Please contact me via my 'Moodle profile' (above) for details as I am an individual and therefore am unable\r\nto have 'buy me now' buttons under their terms.\r\n\r\nFlattr - https://flattr.com/profile/gjb2048\r\n\r\nI develop and maintain for free and any sponsorships to assist me in this endeavour are appreciated\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Installation Requirements'.  This is essential as the\r\n   format relies on underlying core code.\r\n2. If upgrading from a previous version of the format for Moodle 1.9 or 2.0 you should remove the old 'nb' folder\r\n   in '/course/format' and continue.\r\n3. If upgrading from the Moodle 2.3 version, make a backup of the old files in the 'noticebd' folder, clear it out\r\n   and replace with all the files in this version.\r\n4. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' on 'docs.moodle.org/en/admin/setting/maintenancemode' so that there are no \r\n   users using it bar you as the administrator - if you have not already done so.\r\n5. Copy 'noticebd' to '/course/format/'.\r\n6. Login as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to\r\n   'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' if this does not happen.\r\n7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n==============\r\n1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n2. It is recommended but not essential to change all of the courses that use the format to another.  If this is\r\n   not done Moodle will pick the last format in your list of formats but display in 'Edit settings' of the\r\n   course the first format in the list.  You can then set the desired format.\r\n3. In '/course/format/' remove the folder 'noticebd'.\r\n4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n1. When creating a new course, select the course format as 'Noticeboard format' from the list of available options.\r\n2. To change an existing course, edit the course settings (http://docs.moodle.org/29/en/course/edit) and select the\r\n   'Noticeboard format' from the list of available options.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n1. Only administrators can add, edit and remove activities and resources (whilst in the format) from the general\r\n   section (section 0), as to prevent accidental deletion of the 'news' forum upon which the format relies.  If it is\r\n   deleted, then a page refresh will recreate the forum but all previous posts will be lost.\r\n2. Any title and summary that has been previously set for the general section will not be shown.\r\n\r\nVersion Information\r\n===================\r\nSee Changes.md\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nThis file is part of Moodle - http://moodle.org/\r\n\r\nMoodle is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nMoodle is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
